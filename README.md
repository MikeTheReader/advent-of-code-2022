# Advent of Code 2022

This is my work for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022). This year I'm
working in Ruby as I'm trying to improve my usage and knowledge of the language.

## Input

Per the request of Advent of Code, I'm not including my input files in this repo, so actual
solutions cannot be generated without downloading the input files and placing them in
the `lib/2022/input` directory named like `day-1.txt`.

## Running Tests

```
bundle install
bundle exec rspec
```

## Running Solutions

```
bundle install
ruby lib/runner.rb --day 2
```
